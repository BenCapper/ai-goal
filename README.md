# Q2 AI Goal - Bash Script Generator

This is an AI chatbot to generate bash scripts that combines a React frontend with a Flask backend powered by a fine-tuned DeepSeek-Coder model, allowing users to request bash scripts in natural language through a modern web interface.

The model was fine tuned on a dataset of ~10,000 bash scripts. The scripts were generated programmatically via the Gemini API using prompts which were also generated by Gemini.

## Getting Started: Running the Bash Script AI Generator
To run this complete system locally, you will need two separate terminal windows.

**Prerequisites**
- Node.js & npm: (Node Package Manager) - Install from nodejs.org or via Homebrew (brew install node).
- Python 3.11: (Recommended version for stability) - Install via Homebrew (brew install python@3.11).

## Project Setup
Clone the Project

**Copy Trained Model:** 
Ensure your deepseek_bash_finetuned_adapters_custom/best_model/ directory exists. 

Copy its contents into ai-goal/backend/
~~~
cp -r deepseek_bash_finetuned_adapters_custom/best_model/* ai-goal/backend/
~~~

**Set Up Backend (Flask API):**
Create Python Virtual Environment:
~~~
cd backend
python3.11 -m venv venv_backend
source venv_backend/bin/activate
~~~

Install Dependencies:
~~~
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

**Set Up Frontend (React UI with Vite):**
Navigate to frontend:
~~~
cd frontend
~~~
**Install Node Dependencies:**
~~~
npm install
~~~

## Running the Application
You will need two separate terminal windows open.

**Terminal 1: Start the Backend (Flask API)**
Open Terminal 1.
Activate the backend virtual environment:
~~~
source ~/path/ai-goal/backend/venv_backend/bin/activate
~~~
Navigate to the backend directory:
~~~
cd backend
~~~
Run the Flask application:
~~~
python app.py
~~~
Wait for the model to finish loading. This will take a few minutes for the DeepSeek-Coder model. You will see print statements like "Loading model and tokenizer for Flask API..." and eventually "Model and tokenizer loaded successfully for API!" followed by * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/.

Keep this terminal window open while the chatbot is in use.

**Terminal 2: Start the Frontend (React UI)**
Open Terminal 2.
Navigate to the frontend directory:
~~~
cd frontend
~~~

Start the Vite development server:
~~~
npm run dev
~~~
Keep this terminal window open while the chatbot is in use.
Go to the URL provided by npm run dev in Terminal 2 (e.g., http://localhost:5173/).
